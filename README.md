# Purpose

We've all been there its late o'clock and you need to go to the bathroom.
Too far from home?
I hope you're okay with buying some arbitrary amount of product or food from a place thats open for the *privilege* of using a public restroom.
(If there even is a place open)

Now using with the power of the ShARInG EcOnOMy$^{(tm)}$, you can share your life and your bathroom with strangers.

# Registerig for CS252 Project

The Project is meant to expand the sharing economy to where it was never meant to go: the Bathroom

As of the planning stage, I intend to use nodejs, angular?, the google maps api, mongo-db, and possibly a web service such as AWS. If I don't use AWS, I would host it on my personal VPS for the time being.
